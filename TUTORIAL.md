#<b>How to create a sign with SignShop</b>

Before creating a Sign, first of all, if you have permission from an admin, you will not have problems, otherwise you have to ask the creator of the server to do the command /sign setup all

Then, you have to have blocks/items to sufficiency! I am using TNT (id: 46 damage: 0 count: 999);


To create the sign, execute the command /sign created 46 10 30 999 





Places the Sign without changing any value




Now you've created the Sign with money :) :)
